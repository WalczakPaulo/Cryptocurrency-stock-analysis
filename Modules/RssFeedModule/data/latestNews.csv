Jihan Wu and the Jenke Group will be reportedly soon retire as CEOs of leading mining ASIC producer Bitmain. Rumors about their departure were reported by Chinese local media Odaily on Dec. 28.Odaily quotes an unnamed source familiar with the situation that Bitmain is currently in a transition period. Furthermore, the article also reports that employees allegedly werent optimistic about the outcomes of the double-CEO system.The Chinese local outlet also notes that their successor is supposedly surnamed Wang, without providing further information.In mid-November, Chinese local media reported that Wu would no longer be able to influence corporate decisions at the mining manufacturer, alleging that he had been demoted from the position of director to that of supervisor.Odaily also reported today that unspecified sources declared that Bitmain is planning to cease all mining operations and already commissioned the relevant dealers to sell the used Antminer S9s. This, according to the article, would mean that the company will lay off over 500 employees.In mid-May, Wu had told Bloomberg in an interview that the manufacturer was considering turning to artificial intelligence (AI) amid China&rsquo;s crypto crackdown. At the time, Wu predicted that AI chips could account for around 40 percent of Bitmain&rsquo;s revenue in the next five years.The Odaily article referenced the AI division, noting that layoffs would include those from the AI, mining, overseas, and BCH Copernicus client teams.At the end of December, Chinese social media sources reported that Bitmain had already allegedly fired its entire staff of BCH developers.Bitmain has not responded to Cointelegraph&rsquo;s request for comments on the CEO changes or the layoffs by press time.The downward trend reported by the prices of cryptocurrencies this year also hasn&rsquo;t spared graphics processing unit (GPU) producer Nvidia. As Cointelegraph reported today, Nvidia is facing a class action lawsuit over the losses reported by the company when lower crypto prices diminished demand for GPUs by miners.According to the complaint, Nvidia &ldquo;touted its ability to monitor the cryptocurrency market and make rapid changes to its business as necessary.&rdquo; This assumption &mdash; according to the indictment &mdash; is a false and misleading statement.As Cointelegraph also recently reported, after the decrease in GPU demand by miners, Nvidia was the worst performer in S&amp;P 500, losing 54 percent of its stock price.

Huobi Group plans to launch the company&rsquo;s first cryptocurrency exchange &mdash; which will be dedicated to EOS &mdash; in the first quarter of 2019, according to a press release sent to Cointelegraph on Dec. 29.The exchange will be reportedly launched by Huobi Pool, the group&rsquo;s cryptocurrency mining arm. Cao Fei, the CEO of Huobi Pool, described the launch of the EOS exchange as &ldquo;the next logical step in our support&rdquo; as an EOS Block Producer (BP).The release states that the exchange will allow clients to trade in the altcoin EOS against several other cryptocurrencies.Huobi is currently the third-ranked crypto exchange based on the volume on CoinMarketCap, with around $774 million in 24 hour volume at press time.As Cointelegraph reported, the exchange recently also announced support for EOS on its derivative market. The daily traded volume on Huobi&rsquo;s cryptocurrency derivative market also reportedly recently broke $1 billion.The company&rsquo;s derivative market had been launched only about a month before, at the end of November. The advantage that the company stressed when presenting the market at the Cryptofrontiers conference is that it allows customers to take both short and long positions.EOS has been repeatedly criticized for alleged centralization. Recently, Starteos, one of EOS&rsquo; BP&rsquo;s, appeared to publically offer its token holders financial rewards in return for their votes. There have also been investigations in the EOS ecosystem after Huobi was accused of running a corruption scheme.        """

After a massive sell-off of its shares, the stock price of the company fell by 54 percent.In mid-November, an analysis by Susquehanna &mdash; a United States -based global trading and technology firm &mdash; observed that mining Ethereum (ETH) using graphics processing units was no longer profitable.In the Susquehanna analysis, the profit per month for GPU Ethereum miners hit $0 by Nov. 1, down from nearly $150 in July 2017.Earlier this week, Japanese firm GMO Internet announced that they would be leaving the mining sector, citing extraordinary losses over the year.Nvidia has not responded to Cointelegraph&rsquo;s request for comment at press time.

Bitcoin (BTC) has a substantial liberating potential, American mainstream newspaper Time reports on Dec. 28.The aforementioned article claims that &ldquo;speculation, fraud, and greed in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry have overshadowed the real, liberating potential of Satoshi Nakamoto&rsquo;s invention.&rdquo;According to the article&rsquo;s author, Bitcoin &ldquo;can be a valuable financial tool as a censorship-resistant medium of exchange.&rdquo;Alejandro Machado, a cryptocurrency researcher at the Open Money Initiative, reportedly said that the fee on a wire transfer from the United States to Venezuela can be as high as 56 percent.To circumvent such conditions, Venezuelans have reportedly turned to cryptocurrency, receiving Bitcoin from their relatives abroad. The main alternative is to wire money to Colombia, withdraw and bring cash to Venezuela, which according to the article, &ldquo;can take far longer, cost more, and be far more dangerous than the Bitcoin option.&rdquo;Times suggests that Bitcoin is a good way to protect oneself from fiat currency inflation. Venezuela is prime example of that, with the inflation of their native currency projected to top 1 million percent. But there are also other similar examples, like Zimbabwe, where former president Robert Mugabe &ldquo;printed endless amounts of cash.&rdquo; But the author points out:&ldquo;His successors can&rsquo;t print more Bitcoin.&rdquo;Bitcoin is also, according to the article, a tool to evade mass surveillance in places like China. That being said, as Cointelegraph reported in March, according to U.S. whistleblower Edward Snowden, Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t optimal for avoiding government coercion, and he believes that the world needs a better option.Times also points out the advantage given by the inability of governments to censor transactions or freeze Bitcoin wallets. In fact, Cointelegraph reported in April that WikiLeaks&rsquo; Coinbase account has been suspended due to a term of service violation.Still, nobody can prevent WikiLeaks from using cryptocurrency wallets where the organization controls the private keys. In fact, WikiLeaks is still accepting cryptocurrency donations and also added support for Snowden&rsquo;s favorite crypto Zcash in August 2017.       """

The Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) received 190 cryptocurrency exchange license applications, an unnamed FSA staff member told Cointelegraph Japan on Dec. 28.The FSA has given the local crypto industry self-regulatory status, certifying the Japanese Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) to oversee the space. The JVCEA is now expected to develop anti-money-laundering (AML) policy and providing guidelines to crypto exchanges.As Cointelegraph recently reported, such a license was recently granted to cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck. Following a hack at the exchange in January, it received two business improvement orders from the FSA.Those improvement orders were mainly focused on setting higher standards for customer protection and anti-money-laundering measures. The FSA sent &ldquo;punishment notices&rdquo; to seven crypto exchanges in March.The commissioner of Japan&rsquo;s FSA said in August that the agency wished the crypto industry to &ldquo;grow under appropriate regulation.&rdquo; He further reassured that the agency has &ldquo;no intention to curb [the crypto industry] excessively.&rdquo;As the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries have been growing in Japan, so too as the FSA.

2018-12-29,"""Multi-Blockchain Crypto Collectible Game Integrates TRON and Promises Unique Updates""","""                                          sponsored                     The new version of “the cutest crypto game” will include unique tokens, items and locations.                     Blockchain Cuties, a decentralized crypto collectible game already available on two blockchain platforms &mdash; Ethereum (ETH) and EOS &mdash; has recently added a third platform based on the decentralized protocol TRON. Blockchain Cuties has announced that the TRON version of the game will have unique content, including Cuties, items and probably locations.Future of DApps&ldquo;We have been seeking an opportunity to work with TRON since June 2018 and now, we&rsquo;re finally here,&rdquo; Vladimir Tomko, CEO of Blockchain Cuties says. The game developer believes that adding the TRON community will give the users more opportunity in representing their Cuties in the battlefield. Also, the team hopes that integration Blockchain Cuties to the TRON platform will also help achieve the higher transaction speed which brings more options to the gameplay. The TRON team believes that an extension through the sidechain will help achieve its goal of 1,000 transactions per second (TPS). In comparison, Ethereum enables 15 TPS and Bitcoin 7 TPS.Blockchain Cuties says it have a similar vision with TRON. Launched in August 2017, TRON was announced as &ldquo;a blockchain-based decentralized protocol that aims to construct a worldwide free content entertainment system with the blockchain and distributed storage technology. The idea of the new project was to allow users to publish, store and own data for free. The content is supposed to be owned by its creators, artists and scriptwriters rather &ldquo;than the capitalists who consume them.&rdquo; This principle goes along with the Blockchain Cuties&rsquo; concept. The game developer says players finally got full ownership of the Cutie&rsquo;s value that they created. The startup notes that the non-fungible tokens can&rsquo;t be taken from their owners and nobody can dictate players on the usage terms. &ldquo;Thus, Blockchain Cuties and TRON are on the same page in terms of TRON&rsquo;s mission,&rdquo; Blockchain Cuties says. &nbsp;Blockchain Cuties is the first crypto collectible game placed on TRON Arcade &mdash; the special $100 million fund created by TRON. &ldquo;TRON Arcade will play a crucial role in encouraging developers to join in our mission and provide the best blockchain gaming experience to users around the world,&rdquo; TRONs founder and CEO Justin Sun said.Multi-blockchain CutiesThe game was released in April 2018 on Ethereum (ETH) as a part of the boom of crypto-collectible games started with the launch of CryptoPunks &mdash; the first blockchain game ever made &mdash; in June 2017.The developers offered the users the ability to collect, breed and trade non-fungible tokens of different animals &mdash; including cats, lizards, puppies, bears and, most valuable, fantastic creatures. Every Cutie has different attributes like hair style, eye color and facial hair. All these different features of the digital assets increase its value in cryptocurrency and performance. The players can also take part in roll-the-dice battles within the game. The TRON version of the game will include unique TRON Cuties, which are Red Hedgehog, Fairy Dragon, Bear-o-Bull, LilTronbeary and Tronbeary, and many more.In November 2018, Blockchain Cuties announced a partnership with EOS. Enabling the game on the EOS ecosystem made Blockchain Cuties &ldquo;the first game which officially supports two blockchains simultaneously,&rdquo; the developer says. Now, the users have the chance to create both ETH- and EOS-based Cuties. Also, one of the main reasons for the partnership with EOS was the support for non-fungible tokens that the platform provides. Finally, Blockchain Cuties hopes EOS will help make transactions faster &mdash; for example, importing a private key now takes less than a minute, which is then stored locally. &nbsp;Disclaimer.

Ledger claimed that recently uncovered vulnerabilities in its hardware wallets are not critical in an official Medium blog post on Dec. 28.Yesterday at the 35C3 Refreshing Memories conference in Berlin, researchers claimed that they were able to hack the Trezor One, Ledger Nano S and Ledger Blue cryptocurrency wallets.In the post, the company explains that there appeared to be &ldquo;three attack paths which could give the impression that critical vulnerabilities were uncovered,&rdquo; but according to them &ldquo;this is not the case.&rdquo;The reason Ledger says that the vulnerability is not critical is that &ldquo;they did not succeed to extract any seed nor PIN on a stolen device&rdquo; and &ldquo;sensitive assets stored on the Secure Element remain secure.&rdquo;According to the company, the Ledger Nano S vulnerability &ldquo;demonstrated that physically modifying the Ledger Nano S and installing malware on the victim&rsquo;s PC could allow a nearby attacker to sign a transaction after the PIN is entered and the Bitcoin (BTC) app is launched.&rdquo;This, Ledger claims, is &ldquo;quite unpractical, and a motivated hacker would definitely use more efficient tricks.&rdquo; While the researchers claimed that the vulnerability allowed them to &ldquo;send malicious transactions to the ST31 [the secure chip] and even confirm it ourselves&rdquo; Ledger denies its, stating:&ldquo;Their firmware runs snake on the MCU in Bootloader mode. This means that you have to push the left button at boot and the Secure Element does not even boot.&rdquo;Ledger also claims that the demonstration of the Ledger Blue attack is &ldquo;a bit unrealistic and not practical,&rdquo; claiming that &ldquo;the position of the receiver and the attacked device must be exactly the same, &#8202;the position of the USB cable is also paramount (as it acts as an antenna).&rdquo;The post stated that &ldquo;if the conditions are not exactly the same, the machine learning classifier won&rsquo;t work properly.&rdquo; For this reason, Ledger concluded:&ldquo;This attack is definitely interesting, but does not allow to guess someone&rsquo;s PIN in real conditions (it requires that you never move your device at all).&rdquo;Furthermore, because of this vulnerability, Ledger stated that the next Ledger Blue firmware update will feature a randomized keyboard for the pin.The company also stated that they &ldquo;regret that the researchers did not follow the standard security principles outlined in Ledger&rsquo;s Bounty program.&rdquo; According to Ledger &ldquo;in the security world, the usual way to proceed is responsible disclosure. This is the model in which a vulnerability is disclosed only after a reasonable period of time that allows for the vulnerability to be patched as well as to mitigate risks for users.&rdquo;In November, Ledger announced its expansion to New York in order to develop its institutional custody offering Ledger Vault. Moreover, the company also recently signed an agreement with crypto payment startup Crypto.com to allow users to pay for its products with cryptocurrencies.       """

This reportedly made the company consider &ldquo;fundamental&rdquo; changes in its strategy.In 2016, Earthport launched a single application programming interface (API) designed to connect banks to Ripple&rsquo;s distributed ledger protocol when processing cross-border payments, according to financial and business news outlet Finextra. The development was reportedly set to enable banks to overcome budgetary, technology and compliance constraints.In October, Cointelegraph reported that Visa was readying its blockchain-based digital identity system &ldquo;Visa B2B Connect&rdquo; for cross-border payments for launch in the first quarter of 2019. The system reportedly tokenizes sensitive business data &mdash; such as banking details and account numbers &mdash; granting them a unique cryptographic identifier that will be used for transactions on the platform.In June, Visa said that their card payments were experiencing disruptions across the United Kingdom and Europe, while the Payment Systems Regulator asserted that the problem was isolated solely to Visa card payments.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.Market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.Crypto markets have given up some of their recent gains, which is expected. Rarely do markets bottom without forming a basing pattern. Entrepreneur Charles Shrem believes that the current dip is due to the expiration of Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and some last minute tax selling.One good thing about the current bear market in cryptocurrencies is that it has removed most of the hype. Had the bull run continued for a few more months, many more innocent people would have lost money in dubious initial coin offerings (ICOs) and sh*tcoins.With the year coming to an end, all eyes will be on 2019. Many believe that the markets will see an uptick in the next year, supported by favorable conditions. However, the next leg of the rise will require strong support from institutional players.Will Facebook&rsquo;s rumored foray into cryptocurrencies be a game changer or will Amazon give a boost by accepting cryptocurrencies? There are many possibilities, but it is difficult to predict which one will see the light of the day and produce the desired effect.BTC/USDThe major trend in Bitcoin is down while the short-term trend is indecisive. It has broken down of the 20-day EMA and the RSI has dipped back below 50. This shows that the bears are trying to resume the downtrend.However, the bulls are not relenting and are currently attempting to climb above the 20-day EMA once again. If successful, it will form the right shoulder of the inverse head and shoulders pattern.The bullish inverse head and shoulders is a reversal pattern, which will complete on a breakout of the neckline. The breakout has a pattern target of $5,500.Conversely, if the BTC/USD pair fails to cross the neckline or the 50-day SMA and turns down once again, a retest of the Dec. 15 low of $3,236.09 is probable. A break of the yearly lows will resume the downtrend and will be a negative development. The price action of the next few days will confirm whether a bottom is in place.XRP/USDRipple broke below the 20-day EMA on Dec. 27 but has bounced back sharply from the support at $0.33108. We anticipate another attempt by the bulls to break out of $0.40.If successful, the XRP/USD pair can rally to the resistance line of the descending channel. Though $0.45 will act as a resistance, we expect it to be crossed this time.Contrary to our expectation, if the price turns down from $0.40 and plunges below $0.33108, a retest of $0.286 and $0.24508 is probable. We should see a decisive move within the next 3-4 days.ETH/USDEthereum is attempting to bounce from the 20-day EMA. If successful, it will attempt to move up to $167.32 once again.The 20-day EMA is flat and the RSI is also in positive territory, which increases the probability of a move up from current levels. $136.12 might offer minor resistance, but we expect it to be crossed. A move above $167.32 will confirm a bottom at $83 and the start of a new trend.However, if our assumption is proven wrong and the ETH/USD pair plunges below the 20-day EMA, it can slide to $108 and below that to $100. Below $100, a retest of the low is likely.BCH/USDBitcoin Cash broke below the 20-day EMA on Dec. 27 but has bounced back sharply from close to $136.72, which is 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the recent pullback from $73.50 to $239. It is currently trading inside a descending channel, that looks like a bullish signal.On the upside, the virtual currency will face resistance at the channel and above it at the 50-day SMA. If both these levels are crossed, we expect the recovery to resume. The pattern target of the bullish flag is $355, with a minor resistance at $307.10.On the contrary, if the bears turnaround the BCH/USD pair from the current levels and break below the channel, it can slide to $108.92 and below that to the low of $73.50. The next couple of days will give us a better idea about the next direction.EOS/USDThe breakdown of the 20-day EMA and $2.4050 in EOS was short-lived. It has bounced sharply from $2.3093 and has broken above the 20-day EMA. The bulls will try to break out of the 50-day SMA and $3.2081 once again. If successful, it will indicate a change in trend.The 20-day EMA is flat and the RSI is close to 50, which points to a consolidation. However, the long-term trend still remains down.The EOS/USD pair will weaken if it plunges below $2.1733. It will resume its downtrend on a break below $1.55. We do not see any buy setups now, hence, we remain neutral.XLM/USDStellar is trading below the 20-day EMA, which is flat. The RSI is also in the negative territory. This shows that the bears are trying to make a comeback.The virtual currency will point to a reversal if it breaks out and closes (UTC time frame) above $0.13427050. Such a move can reach the 50-day SMA and above it to $0.184. We do not see any buy patterns at current levels; hence, we suggest traders remain on the sidelines.If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and sinks below $0.10754201, the XLM/USD pair will decline to the Dec. 15 low of $0.09285498. A break of this level will resume the downtrend.LTC/USDThe bulls could not keep Litecoin above the 20-day EMA and the critical support at $29.349 on Dec. 27. However, the breakdown proved to be temporary because the price has climbed back above the 20-day EMA once again. This shows buying on dips, which is a bullish sign.The 20-day EMA is flat and the RSI is close to 50. This points to a consolidation in the short-term. A rally above $36.428 will complete a head and shoulders pattern that can result in a rally to $49.756. We shall turn positive on a close above $36.428.However, if the price reverses direction from the 50-day SMA or $36.428 and plunges below $27.701, a retest of the low is likely. The downtrend will resume if the LTC/USD pair plummets below $23.10.BSV/USDBitcoin SV is range bound between $123.98 and $80.352. The price is currently close to the bottom of the range. A break below $80.352 will be a negative development and will drag the price lower to $65.031. If this level also crumbles, a retest of the low at $38.528 will be in the cards.However, if the bulls succeed in defending $80.352, the BSV/USD pair will again attempt to move back up to $123.98. Though the range is large enough for trading, we shall wait for the bounce off the supports to sustain before recommending any trade in it. &nbsp;TRX/USDTRON held on to the critical support at $0.0183 for the past three days and is currently rebounding sharply. This shows strong buying at the supports, which is a bullish sign.The TRX/USD pair is likely to consolidate in the large range of $0.0183&ndash;$0.02815521 for a few more days. The digital currency is turning out to be an outperformer, hence, the traders can buy fresh long positions closer to $0.02 with a stop loss just below the support of $0.0183. We like the way the 20-day EMA has continued to slope up after completing the bullish crossover.Contrary to our expectation, if the bears sink the price below $0.0183 and the 20-day EMA, a fall to $0.015 is likely. Any break of this level will result in a retest of the lows.ADA/USDThe bulls are attempting to push Cardano above the 20-day EMA once again. There is a tussle between both the bears and the bulls at current levels. The 50-day SMA is sloping down, which means that the long-term trend still remains down. However, the flat 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory, and shows that the bulls have an advantage in the short-term.The ADA/USD pair will confirm a trend change if the price breaks out and closes (UTC time frame) above the neckline of the probable inverse head and shoulders pattern. We suggest traders wait for the reversal to complete before jumping in to buy.If the virtual currency turns down from the 50-day SMA or the trendline and breaks below $0.036934, it can result in a retest of the Dec. 7 low.Market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

The startup aims to start a &ldquo;financial revolution&rdquo; by creating its own social network, where users can earn tokens and spend them by hiring top investment professionals and investing in the products and services they choose. The idea of the Huddl project is to break the traditional investment model, in which the company says that premium products are available only for wealthy people or for institutional investors.The Huddl team says the main reason that motivated them to build the platform was the loss of trust in traditional financial services and social networks, and the lack of utility in current blockchain and decentralized application structures.Investment networkHuddl wants to give regular users access to such premium investment opportunities like commercial real estate, private banking, hedge funds, pre-IPO stocks, investment management and wealth planning. Normally these high-risk asset classes are not available for the general public, and mainstream investors have to pay much higher fees than institutional ones.The Huddl team offers a way to gain access to these premium investment services and products by becoming a member of Huddl&rsquo;s own network. The members share their investment preferences and examine the different strategies that are offered within the platform. They can invite friends, relatives and people they know to form an online community or a dynamic investment pool, which Huddl calls a &nbsp;&ldquo;pod.&rdquo; Together, the pool members define the purpose of the investment, agree on the rules, choose the investment strategy, invest their capital and spend their tokens for the goal that they choose. For example, a family can jointly invest for retirement or smaller things, such as a friends vacation. The pod can also invite highly skilled financial professionals to manage their investment program.The pools vary according to their size: from pods (the smallest unit in Huddl network) to &ldquo;clusters,&rdquo; which can include multiple pods with shared interests in strategies and investments. According to the company, this system allows Huddl users to pool their money together and increase their collective buying power for gaining access to premium investment opportunities while fully controlling how their capital is managed.Within the Huddl network, users can share their ideas and ask for help from advisors and managers. &ldquo;Through social clusters and collaborative idea sharing, individuals are empowered to form their own investment vehicles and have them managed by top private wealth advisors,&rdquo; says Huddl Founder and CEO Stephen Corliss.&ldquo;Deep discounts&rdquo;The Huddl network is based on blockchain technology. The users can earn their first tokens by joining Huddl &mdash; they get rewarded for bringing new users and adding value to the network, as well as for inviting friends and family to become members. The startup also notes that there is a special social program embedded in the system, which allows every community member to benefit from the growth of the platform.Additionally, the users can earn Huddl tokens by interacting, contributing to the teams as a manager or a coordinator, and by investing. The digital currency can be spent on unlocking investment services at &ldquo;deep discounts,&rdquo; which Huddl promises to arrange.Disclaimer.

Scott Galit, CEO of New York-headquartered payments processing firm Payoneer, says a single global, non-fiat currency such as Bitcoin (BTC) is unrealistic. Galit made his remarks during an interview with CNBC published on Dec. 28.Payoneer is a financial services company that provides cross-border money digital payment support for businesses and professionals across 200 countries, and was named CNBC&rsquo;s thirteenth most disruptive company of 2018.Galit built his argument against frictionless commerce, money and avoiding fiat currencies becoming a reality on two main points &mdash; the opposition of national governments and the concerns of central banks, with a focus primarily on the United States context.In regard to the former, he argued that governments&rsquo; reliance on taxation for their revenue means that they will resist allowing residents to meet their tax obligations in a highly volatile currency such as Bitcoin.He claimed that if fiat currency experienced the same degree of volatility as crypto, no government would be able to meet their financial obligations and ultimately be able to fund services for their residents.As CNBC notes, in the U.S. context, some state governments have become less reluctant to interact with the world of cryptocurrencies of late &mdash; Ohio became the U.S.&rsquo;s first to allow its residents to pay certain taxes in Bitcoin. Nonetheless, the bottom line of this interaction is that the Bitcoin is first converted into fiat currency via the state&rsquo;s OhioCrypto.com portal before it reaches government pockets.In regard to central banks, Galit went on to argue that:&ldquo;Central bankers are there to actually help manage economies and provide a kind of stewardship for for those economies [...] Part of that is actually managing currency in the interest rates [for lending] and in exchange rates. If you don&rsquo;t actually have any control over a currency you&rsquo;ve lost one of the major policy tools that you have, so what do you do?&rdquo;As previously reported, major innovators worldwide have dissented from Galit&rsquo;s view. This May, Jack Dorsey &mdash; the CEO of stalwart social media platform Twitter as well as Bitcoin-supporting payments firm firm Square&nbsp;&mdash; stated his view that &ldquo;the internet deserves a native currency,&rdquo; placing virtual currencies at the centre of his vision of a future, frictionless means of global payment. Dorsey&rsquo;s view was later explicitly affirmed by Apple&rsquo;s co-founder Steve Wozniak.     """
2018-12-28,"""WSJ: Bitcoin Trading at Strong Correlation with Gold as Traditional Investors Step In""","""                                                               A Wall Street Journal has suggested that Bitcoin’s correlation with “traditional” assets markets has been high in recent days.                     A Wall Street Journal (WSJ) article published today, Dec. 28, suggests that Bitcoin (BTC)&rsquo;s correlation with traditional assets markets has been high in recent days.Citing data from research firm Excalibur Pro Inc., the WSJ states that the top cryptocurrency has traded at a 0.84 correlation to gold over the past five days, where -1 indicates complete inversion and +1 perfect correlation. Moreover, Bitcoin has traded at a 0.77 correlation to the Chicago Board of Options Exchange&rsquo;s Volatility index (VIX), a benchmark index for the United States equity market volatility.While the WSJ frames the strong correlation between traditional markets and what the article dubs as the rebellious first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, as something of an unexpected twist of fate, the article also offers several explanations as to why the pattern may have formed.The first is the reported influx of institutional money into the crypto space, with the WSJ citing the growth of Grayscale Investments&rsquo; over-the-counter exchange-traded fund (ETF), the Bitcoin Investment Trust, as a prime example.As per the article, the trust saw $51 million in assets under management (AUM) during its first year (2013). By the end of 2017, in the midst of the crypto market bull run, AUM had surged to around &nbsp;$3.5 billion. As of recently &mdash; due to the so-called &ldquo;crypto winter&rdquo; &mdash; the trust reportedly retains about $900 million AUM.Another factor proffered is venture capital (VC) investment. The WSJ reports that whereas in 2013, VC investment in Bitcoin and the blockchain sector was at around $96 million, this grew to $500 million in 2016 and to over $2 billion in all-time VC crypto investment through the end of 2017. The WSJ gives no fresh data for 2018.As the article notes, a pull factor for traditional capital into crypto is the building of trading services and infrastructure with high regulatory compliance; the advent of crypto futures trading, and attempts to gain broad acceptance for crypto-based ETFs.As reported, the crypto space continues to undergo far-ranging transformation; major developments on the horizon include the launch of the Bakkt Bitcoin futures exchange from Intercontinental Exchange, the launch of investment giant Fidelity&rsquo;s digital assets business, and the continued influx of stalwart investors such as Yale, Harvard and Stanford Universities.

Daily traded volume of cryptocurrency contracts on the Huobi Derivatives Market (DM) has broken past $1 billion, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph on Dec. 27.Huobi Global &mdash; which operates the world&rsquo;s third-largest largest crypto spot market trading platform &mdash; launched Huobi DM last month. The new platform allows traders to trade Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) contracts that aim to allow for arbitrage, speculation, and hedging.Having reportedly broken past $1 billion in daily trades on Dec. 25, Huobi DM is today expanding its crypto contracts offerings to include altcoin EOS. Huobi claims its crypto contracts help market participants control risk and uncertainty via price limit mechanisms and supervision tools that allow traders to monitor contract and index prices and positions in real time.Livio Weng, Huobi Global CEO, has emphasized that the offerings aim to engage those who wish to control risks in a volatile trading climate. According to the company, Dec. 25 saw strong engagement on both the newly-launched DM platform and Huobi&rsquo;s flagship crypto exchange; their combined daily traded volume was purportedly $2 billion.Huobi DM&rsquo;s launch comes at a moment when trading volumes across various exchanges are reported to have fallen dramatically.A recent study from weekly crypto outlet Diar claimed that data sampled from across eight leading crypto exchanges &nbsp;&mdash; Binance, OKex, Huobi, Bitfinex, Kraken, Poloniex, Bittrex and HitBTC &mdash; showed that 60 percent of the still-listed cryptocurrencies are now trading at lower volumes than in January. Over 20 percent of these were seeing less than 90 percent of the volumes they saw during January&rsquo;s crypto market bull run.Moreover, controversies continue to beset the accuracy of reported daily traded volumes.A recent report from the Blockchain Transparency Institute (BTI) claimed that the majority of the top 25 Bitcoin (BTC) trading pairs listed on CoinMarketCap (CMC) are based upon highly inflated false volumes, showing evidence of malpractices such as wash trading. Huobi &mdash; alongside HitBTC, OKEx and Bithumb &mdash; were among those exchanges implicated in the researchers&rsquo; findings.This summer, CoinMarketCap implemented major changes to its crypto exchange listings method in light of concerns over skewed trade volume data.

2018-12-28,"""From Blanket Ban to Its Own Stablecoin: How Facebook’s Relationship With Crypto Changed Over 2018""","""                                                               Facebook is now making a stablecoin for WhatsApp, reports suggest.                     On Dec. 20, Bloomberg reported that Facebook is making a stablecoin for WhatsApp users. The cryptocurrency will reportedly be used for money transfers made within the messaging app and will focus on the Indian market.The move provides a curious juxtaposition for the social media giant, which banned cryptocurrency-related advertising across its network back in January and then partly reversed it in June.Here&rsquo;s how Facebook&rsquo;s relationship with cryptocurrencies and blockchain has been developing in 2018 &mdash; overall, it has been a patchy road.January: Zuckerberg is being bullish about crypto; Facebook bans crypto adsOn Jan. 4, Mark Zuckerberg set out his person challenge for 2018: to fix Facebook. While this year brought even more problems for the social media giant &mdash; Zuckerberg&rsquo;s sweaty testimony on data privacy before the United States Congress being a primary example &mdash; the Facebook CEO seemed optimistic about the company&rsquo;s future at the start of 2018. Interestingly, he cited encryption and cryptocurrencies as potential ways to empower users in his Facebook post:There are important counter-trends to this &ndash; like encryption and cryptocurrency &ndash; that take power from centralized systems and put it back into peoples hands. [&hellip;] Im interested to go deeper and study the positive and negative aspects of these technologies, and how best to use them in our services.Despite Zuckerberg&rsquo;s bullish statement, on Jan. 30, Facebook announced that it will prohibit ads that use &ldquo;misleading or deceptive promotional practices,&rdquo; referring specifically to initial coin offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrencies. Rob Leathern, product management director at Facebook, explained the company&rsquo;s decision in a blog post:&ldquo;We want people to continue to discover and learn about new products and services through Facebook ads without fear of scams or deception. That said, there are many companies who are advertising binary options, ICOs and cryptocurrencies that are not currently operating in good faith.&rdquo;The ban was &ldquo;intentionally broad,&rdquo; meaning that the social media company decided to ban all cryptocurrency ads on its platforms (namely Facebook, Instagram and Audience networks) first, and then find out how to pick out ones that are actually &ldquo;deceptive.&rdquo; However, Leathern also stated that the company intends to &ldquo;revisit this policy and how [they] enforce it as [their] signals improve.&rdquo;Facebook&rsquo;s move seemed to coincide with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s (SEC) public announcement regarding crypto-related investments and ICOs, which was published earlier in December 2017. In that statement, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton suggested that there is a growing trend for &ldquo;fraud and manipulation&rdquo; in the cryptocurrency and ICO markets due to their rising popularity.Importantly, by rolling out its crypto ad ban, Facebook had set a precedent for other big tech companies, as Google and Twitter eventually followed suit. There was a shorter-term effect, too: The Facebook blanket ban was followed by a large Bitcoin (BTC) price drop, as it went from $11,200 to $8,800 over the few days after the decision was announced.February: Facebook has no plans for crypto, says its head of MessagingOn Feb. 2, CNBC published an interview with David Marcus, Facebook&rsquo;s head of Messenger and Coinbase board member, who has also admitted to having &ldquo;a longtime&rdquo; interest in cryptocurrencies.Marcus told the news outlet that crypto won&rsquo;t appear on his platform anytime soon, citing cost and scalability issues:&ldquo;Payments using crypto right now is just very expensive, super slow, so the various communities running the different blockchains and the different assets need to fix all the issues, and then when we get there someday, maybe we&rsquo;ll do something,&rdquo;During the interview, Marcus also defended Facebook&rsquo;s decision to ban all crypto-related ads:&ldquo;We want to protect the community. That&rsquo;s job number one. All the legitimate people in the crypto world that I spoke to at least thanked me for what we just did with that move. [...] The reality is the vast majority of these ads were a scam and we cannot allow scams to exist on our platform.&rdquo;However, he noted that the policy might be reviewed &ldquo;once the industry self regulates a lot better and you have better more legit products that want to be advertised on the platform.&rdquo;May: Facebook forms its Blockchain team; rumors about social media&rsquo;s own crypto emergeOn May 8, Facebook unveiled its blockchain plans, as David Marcus announced that he will head up the technology-focused group assembled within the social networking service company.&ldquo;Im setting up a small group to explore how to best leverage blockchain across Facebook, starting from scratch,&rdquo; Marcus stated on his personal page.A few days later, on May 11, news outlet Cheddar reported that the social media outlet is &ldquo;very serious&rdquo; about launching its own cryptocurrency. Cheddar&rsquo;s anonymous sources &ldquo;familiar with Facebook&rsquo;s plans&rdquo; reportedly said that Facebook is &ldquo;specifically interested in creating its own digital token&rdquo; for its 2 billion users.The company did not respond to rumors about the cryptocurrency, limiting their statement to a brief comment on the newly established blockchain team:Like many other companies, Facebook is exploring ways to leverage the power of blockchain technology. This new small team is exploring many different applications. We don&rsquo;t have anything further to share.June: Facebook backpedals on the crypto ad banOn June 26, Facebook made somewhat of a U-turn in regard to its views on crypto. The social media giant updated its policies to once again allow cryptocurrency ads on the platform &mdash; however, it has kept its ban on ICOs.In the accompanying announcement, Facebook said it has been looking into the best way of &ldquo;refining&rdquo; its blanket ban on crypto-related ads &ldquo;over the last few months,&rdquo; in order to &ldquo;allow some ads while also working to ensure that they&rsquo;re safe.&rdquo; &nbsp;Facebooks revised prohibited products and services policy stated:&ldquo;Starting June 26, we&rsquo;ll [...] allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we&rsquo;ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.&rdquo;However, the updated policy required advertisers to submit an application so that Facebook can evaluate their qualification to run crypto-related ads. Specifically, applicants were advised to include &ldquo;any licenses they have obtained, whether they are traded on a public stock exchange, and other relevant public background on their business.&rdquo; Ultimately, Facebook stated that &ldquo;not everyone who wants to advertise will be able to do so.&rdquo;July: Facebook&rsquo;s director of engineering moves to its blockchain teamOn July 6, Evan Cheng, Facebook&rsquo;s director of engineering of three years, moved to the same position at the company&rsquo;s recently established blockchain team led by David Marcus.The software engineer updated his LinkedIn profile to reflect the newly acquired position, and the change has also been confirmed by Facebook.Prior to this, Cheng was heading up the programming languages and runtimes division at Facebook for about three years. Before joining the social media company, Cheng was working on back-end engineering for the tech giant Apple for almost 10 years.August: Marcus leaves Coinbase to avoid conflict of interest; Facebook denies working with StellarOn Aug. 10, Marcus announced he was quitting his position on the board of Coinbase, which he obtained in December 2017:&ldquo;Because of the new group Im setting up at Facebook around Blockchain, Ive decided it was appropriate for me to resign from the Coinbase board. [...] Ive been thoroughly impressed by the talent and execution the team has demonstrated during my tenure, and I wish the team all the success it deserves going forward.&rdquo;According to a Facebook spokesperson cited by CNBC, the move was &ldquo;to avoid the appearance of conflict, rather than because of an actual conflict.&rdquo;Also on Aug. 10, Business Insider reported that Facebook and Stellar, a decentralized protocol for cross-border digital currency to fiat currency transfers, had been considering a potential partnership to build a Facebook variant of the Stellar blockchain. The move &ldquo;could shed light on Facebooks ambitions to push into finance and take on big banks,&rdquo; the report suggested.However, Facebook promptly denied entering into talks with cryptocurrency firm Stellar. The social media giant&rsquo;s spokesman reportedly told Cheddar that Facebook was &ldquo;not engaged in any discussions with Stellar, and [was] not considering building on their technology&rdquo; on the same day.December: Facebook&rsquo;s blockchain arm is on a hiring spree; rumors about a WhatsApp stablecoin surfaceIn December, the Facebook blockchain arm&rsquo;s hiring spree was noticed by Cointelegraph, as the social media company listed at least five new blockchain-related positions on its careers page over three weeks, most of which have been closed as of press time.The only remaining position mentioning blockchain is for a business development lead, for which potential applicants are required to have a &ldquo;deep understanding of blockchain product and technology&rdquo; in order to &ldquo;inform and influence [Facebook&rsquo;s] product roadmap and support and execute on product plans.&rdquo;As per Cheddar, by Dec. 13, Facebook&rsquo;s blockchain department, once categorized by its head David Marcus as &ldquo;small,&rdquo; had nearly 40 employees. Facebook job listings state that its blockchain group&rsquo;s &ldquo;ultimate goal is to help billions of people with access to things they dont have now,&rdquo; which &ldquo;could be things like equitable financial services, new ways to save, or new ways to share information.&rdquo;Further, in December, rumors about the Facebook-run cryptocurrency reignited once again. First, Cheddar cited a source who said that &ldquo;Facebook employees pitched the idea of creating a decentralized digital currency&rdquo; at a private dinner the company hosted during an unspecified crypto conference.Further, on Dec. 21, Bloomberg followed with a more detailed report, stating that the social media company is making a cryptocurrency for users of the messaging service WhatsApp, which Facebook obtained for $19 billion back in 2014.The token will allegedly allow users to make money transfers within the messaging app and will focus on the remittances market in India, where WhatsApp is reported to have more than 200 million users. According to data from the World Bank, the country received nearly $69 billion in foreign remittances in 2017, which is 2.8 percent of India&rsquo;s GDP.More specifically, Bloomberg&rsquo;s sources said that Facebook is developing a stablecoin. However, it is not likely to be released anytime soon, as the social media company is reportedly still figuring out which asset their stablecoin will be tied to.As for public comments, Facebook has been forwarding the same statement since May, when first rumors regarding their own crypto emerged. It reads: Like many other companies, Facebook is exploring ways to leverage the power of blockchain technology. This new small team is exploring many different applications. We don&rsquo;t have anything further to share.         """

Senior executives at United Airlines (UA) and logistics giant UPS think 2019 will not be the year blockchain goes mainstream, the Wall Street Journal reported on Dec. 28.Speaking to the publication, UPS chief engineering and information officer Juan Perez and UA&rsquo;s executive vice president of technology and chief digital officer Linda Jojo remained level-headed on blockchain&rsquo;s prospects.&ldquo;We have a small team looking at blockchain, but we are still searching for the killer use case,&rdquo; Jojo said.As 2018 draws to a close, blockchain has faced mixed reviews in the press and from businesses, some sources claiming the technology is not developed enough to fulfil its disruptive and even innovative promises.By contrast, the year began with companies seeing huge share price increases simply by adding the term &ldquo;blockchain&rdquo; to their name.Gauging genuine interest from the international community has been difficult, with a survey by India&rsquo;s Tata Communications this month nonetheless revealing a 44 percent uptake rate for blockchain across international respondents.Governments also continue to signal their desire to get a hold on the phenomenon, with Italy this week publishing a list of 30 &ldquo;high-level experts&rdquo; who will help develop an official state strategy.For UPS, however, it is still too soon for real implementation.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect significant benefits in 2019, primarily because the technology itself is continuing to evolve and mature,&rdquo; Perez continued, adding:&ldquo;It requires a lot of parties to come to the table to participate and evaluate the technology.&rdquo;In August, the company had issued a blockchain-related patent for the logistics industry.

2018-12-28,"""Research Team Demonstrates Hard Wallets Vulnerabilities, Trezor Promises Firmware Update""","""                                                               Software security researchers have reportedly been able to extract private keys from the Trezor One hardware wallets.                     Researchers have reportedly shown how they were able to hack the Trezor One, Ledger Nano S and Ledger Blue at the 35C3 Refreshing Memories conference. The demonstration of the hacks was published in a video on Dec. 27.The research team behind the dubbed &ldquo;Wallet.fail&rdquo; hacking project is made up of hardware designer and security researcher Dmitry Nedospasov, software developer Thomas Roth and security researcher and former submarine officer Josh Datko.During the conference, the researchers announced that they have been able to extract the private key out of a Trezor One hardware wallet after flashing &mdash; overwriting existing data &mdash; a custom firmware. However, they pointed out that this exploit only works if the user didn&rsquo;t set a passphrase.Pavol Rusnak, CTO of SatoshiLabs (the company behind Trezor), commented on Twitter that they were not notified through their Responsible Disclosure program prior to the demonstration, and that they will address the reported vulnerabilities through a firmware update at the end of January.Moreover, the same group of hacker researchers also claimed during the talk that they were able to install any firmware on a Ledger Nano S, a leading hardware wallet. While the team used this vulnerability to play the game Snake on the device, one member of the team that found the exploit claimed:&ldquo;We can send malicious transactions to the ST31 [the secure chip] and even confirm it ourselves [via software,] or we can even go and show a different transaction [not the one that is actually being sent] on the screen.&rdquo;The team also demonstrated that they found a vulnerability in the Ledger Blue, the most expensive hardware wallet produced by the company, that comes with a color touchscreen. The signals are transported to the screen by an unusually long trace on the motherboard, the researcher explained, which is why it leaks those signals as radio waves.When a USB cable is attached to the device, the aforementioned leaked signals get strong enough that, according to the researchers, they could be easily received from several meters.Employing an artificial intelligence (AI) software deployed on the cloud, the team has been reportedly able to obtain the pin of the device from a dump of the leaked radio signal from the moment when the pin has been entered.Ledger responded to the researcher&rsquo;s finding with a statement claiming that the reported vulnerabilities are not critical to the wallet&rsquo;s security.When asked about BitFi, the hardware wallet promoted as being &ldquo;unhackable&rdquo; by crypto advocate John McAfee in July, a team member said that &ldquo;we only talk about somewhat secure wallets&rdquo; before concluding that &ldquo;we didn&rsquo;t want to use a Chinese phone in this talk.&rdquo;As Cointelegraph reported in August, a teenage hacker claimed to have compromised the BitFi device. The producer has since denied that the device has been hacked since no coins have been extracted.Moreover, also in August, a group of researchers declared to have successfully sent signed transactions from the BitFi wallet, claiming to meet the conditions of the bounty program.As of press time, Trezor have responded to Cointelegraph&rsquo;s request for comments.

A United States court has rejected repeated requests from nChain chief scientist Craig Wright to dismiss a $4 billion lawsuit against him, documents revealed Dec. 27.In the latest stage of an ongoing legal battle over Wright&rsquo;s alleged theft of Bitcoin (BTC) from the estate of deceased crypto developer David Kleiman, a South Florida District Court judge denied an application to have the charges thrown out.The case originally came to court in February, with Kleiman&rsquo;s family alleging Wright stole up to 1.1 million BTC after he passed away.Wright, who has proclaimed himself to be Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, vyed with Kleiman as possible candidates for the anonymous early developer of the cryptocurrency.After Kleiman&rsquo;s death in 2013, Wright had contacted his estate, claiming to want to help dispose of the Bitcoin fortune.Wright in part did so, but did not return the funds, the family says. In an amended lawsuit supported by judge Beth Bloom, a figure of 300,000 BTC is now circulating.&ldquo;The Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged a claim for conversion,&rdquo; the court document confirms, continuing:&ldquo;The Amended Complaint alleges that Defendant converted at least 300,000 bitcoins upon Dave&rsquo;s death and transferred them to various international trusts, which was an unauthorized act that deprived the Plaintiffs of the bitcoins therein. Accordingly, Plaintiffs&rsquo; claim for conversion&hellip; survives Defendant&rsquo;s Motion to Dismiss.&rdquo;Wright has until Jan. 10 to respond to the counts which remain outstanding.The move caps a contentious year for the entrepreneur, whose favored altcoin Bitcoin SV (BSV) has faced negative publicity since it hard forked from Bitcoin Cash (BCH) in November.

2018-12-28,"""From “Obsolete” Blockchain to Bitcoin at $1 Mln: Predictions of 2018""","""                                                               The most noticeable 2018 predictions on cryptocurrency rates, blockchain adoption and a Bitcoin ETF, which either became a reality or failed.                     The world of cryptocurrencies is full of prophets and predictions of all ranges, just as any other financial market in the world. 2018 jumped right in with Bitcoin (BTC) hovering around $15,000 and investors being far too optimistic about the future of digital currencies. Some of the premonitions &mdash; especially related to BTC&rsquo;s price by the end of the year &mdash; never came true, but many turned out to be quite realistic. Let&rsquo;s take a look back at all of those hopes and fears.Predictions that went wrongTom Lee: BTC will reach $25KSeems that one of the world&rsquo;s major crypto bulls, co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors Tom Lee, has had some bad luck predicting possible BTC rates. His main prophecy of the coin reaching $25,000 by the end of 2018, which he first expressed in January and then reiterated several times throughout the year, looks unlikely &mdash; as of December 2018, to say the least.Lee himself admitted his stance was a mistake, first lowering the end-year mark to $15,000 and finally refusing to give any comments on the price of BTC:&ldquo;We are tired of people asking us about target prices. Because of the inherent volatility in crypto, we will cease to provide any timeframes for the realization of fair value.&rdquo;However, Lee still believes that the fair value of BTC is much higher than its current price. 2019 is almost here to prove whether Fundstrat&rsquo;s co-founder is right.Mike Novogratz: Institutions will dive into cryptoMike Novogratz, an ex-Goldman Sachs partner and founder of crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital, was quite accurate in his 2018 predictions. In mid-December, after a significant market decline dubbed the &ldquo;crypto winter,&rdquo; he said that BTC&rsquo;s price would not sink more, staying somewhere between $3,000 and $6,000, and he turned out to be right.But his optimism toward institutional players entering the crypto industry was seemingly premature. &ldquo;I think Q1 [or] Q2 [2019] if the institutions start coming in, we&rsquo;ll put in new highs,&rdquo; he said in October. Still, Bloomberg&rsquo;s most recent report states that Wall Street&rsquo;s dreams of crypto are now in a state of limbo, as the value of cryptocurrencies has fallen. The insiders told Bloomberg that financial giants &mdash; such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Citigroup &mdash; actually gave up their plans until a time when demand is higher.Bloomberg: BTC is heading toward $1.5KIn fact, Bloomberg&rsquo;s analysts themselves are prone to making mistakes when it comes to predictions. Just a few weeks ago, shortly after the first signs of the steep market drop, the media stated that BTC was heading toward the $1,500 mark, which would mean a 70 percent drop in the coin&rsquo;s price. Well, the year is not yet over, but this forecast doesn&rsquo;t seem realistic.At least they get points for saying that &ldquo;Bitcoin&rsquo;s no longer boring.&rdquo;George Friedman: Blockchain will become obsoleteGeorge Friedman, a geopolitical analyst for the online publication Geopolitical Futures, said in an interview back in June that blockchain technology would one day become obsolete, stating that the technology is just another fad.While Friedman did not specify the time span he was talking about, as of late 2018, blockchain is very far from being outdated. The mass adoption is no longer a vain fantasy, as governments around the globe keep testing blockchain in different areas. Even China, which has continued to impose a strict ban on initial coin offerings (ICO) and domestic crypto exchanges, acknowledges the advantages of decentralized technology and has its own blockchain pilot zone.It seems like the aging of blockchain in 2018 is more like a dystopian science fiction story rather than reality.John McAfee: BTC will hit $500K in three yearsAn old-but-gold, unrealistic prediction by John McAfee, a cybersecurity legend and renown crypto enthusiast, was made in 2017, but is still relevant due to his extraordinary promise. Back then, McAfee promised that he would eat my d--- on national television if BTC failed to move above $500,000 mark by 2020.As 2018 is almost over, there&rsquo;s only one year left for McAfee not to split up with his manly parts. However, the cybersecurity pioneer&rsquo;s spirit is still strong. He even raised the bar to $1 million and mocked his own bet in a recent Twitter post, claiming that &mdash; in the worst case &mdash; he would &ldquo;probably subcontract the task to a relay team of Bangkok prostitutes.&rdquo; Well, all there is to do now is wait and see what happens.Predictions that came trueAri Paul: BTC and BCH will have more hard forksAri Paul, the co-founder of the large-scale cryptocurrency hedge fund Block Tower, made a set of forecasts on his Twitter at the very beginning of 2018. Some of them were a bit precipitate, but Paul managed to predict Bitcoin Cash (BCH) hard fork. The entrepreneur then wrote:&ldquo;Both BTC and BCH will continue to hard fork and &gt;10% of the value of each (if held today) will reside in new offshoots.&rdquo;Another BTC split has not yet happened, but the BCH hard fork took place in November and resulted in a hash war and massive split for the coin, which practically divided into BCH ABC and BCH SV. &nbsp;Todd Gordon: BTC will drop to $4,000Almost six months before the &ldquo;crypto winter,&rdquo; when most of the enthusiasts still maintained high-rate forecasts, Todd Gordon from TradingAnalysis.com clearly predicted Bitcoins drop to $4,000. Moreover, the coin has recently even dipped below $3,500.However, the second part of his prediction is still unclear. Will Bitcoin recover in 2019 and surpass the $10,000 mark yet again? Only time will tell.Reggie Brown: BTC ETF won&rsquo;t happen anytime soonReggie Brown, a senior managing director and head of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) &nbsp;traded at the financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald, is hailed as the &ldquo;Godfather of ETFs.&rdquo; In November, he claimed a BTC ETF will not be certified anytime soon, and was practically right.His forecast was soon approved by a commissioner of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In December, Hester Peirce, dubbed the &ldquo;Crypto Mom&rdquo; by the crypto community for her pro-crypto statements, urged the community not to hold its breath waiting for a BTC ETF:&ldquo;Definitely possible could be 20 years from now or it could be tomorrow. Don&rsquo;t hold your breath. The SEC took a long time to [establish] Finhub. It might take even longer to approve an exchange-traded product.&rdquo;Blythe Masters: Blockchain benefits to hit commodity supply chains Former JPMorgan Chase executive Blythe Masters predicted in October that a double- to possibly a triple-digit number of blockchain projects would soon increase the efficiency of commodity markets.It might be tens rather than hundreds so far, but several recent blockchain projects in agriculture and oil industries prove that her statement is pretty relevant. For instance, the world&rsquo;s four largest agriculture companies &mdash; known together as ABCD &mdash; are integrating blockchain for automating grain and oilseed post-trade execution processes. And major oil companies &mdash; such as BP, Shell and Equinor &mdash; have united with large banks and trading houses to launch a blockchain-driven platform called Vakt for energy commodity trading.Chris Concannon: ICO markets to face SEC lawsuitsIn June, Chris Concannon, the president of CBOE Global Markets, said that class-action lawsuits would overwhelm the companies behind ICO projects. He also urged ICO investors to keep their hands on the pulse of the future regulatory reckoning.Several months after his claim, his words were backed up by the SEC. In November, the U.S. regulator imposed its first civil penalties against two ICOs, solely over their failure to register their token sales. One does not have to search very far to see that this battle has only started.P.S. Joseph Lubin: The bright future awaitsThe last, but not least prediction has just been made by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, who has recently claimed that the price bottom has been left behind, adding the icing on the cake in another tweet dedicated to scalability issues:&ldquo;The sky is not falling. From my perspective the future looks very bright.&rdquo;This claim, however, is yet to be proven. 2019 has 365 days ahead to surprise the crypto industry and mere spectators alike.

Recent research by the Wall Street Journal published Dec. 27 revealed that hundreds of cryptocurrency offerings showed signs of fraudulent activity, improbable returns and plagiarism.In the course of its research, the WSJ downloaded &ldquo;white papers&rdquo; of 3,291 cryptocurrency projects that announced an initial coin offering (ICO) from three websites &mdash; ICOBench.com, Tokendata.io and ICORating.com.A white paper is an informational document issued by a company that describes the company&rsquo;s position, team biography, and technical specifics of a project, and is designed to be used as a marketing tool for potential investors.The reporters further conducted an analysis of the documents, excluding duplicate and non-English papers:&ldquo;To identify duplicate language, the Journal compared sentences with at least 10 unique words to every other sentence in other white papers. Reporters then read and reviewed nearly 10,000 sentences appearing more than once among the 3,291 papers analyzed and removed technical and legal sounding language. Then, the Journal compared reported offering dates to determine which document first published any given sentence and excluded those projects from this database.&rdquo;The analysis reportedly indicated that 16 percent &mdash; or 513 &mdash; of the aforementioned white papers showed signs of plagiarism, identity theft and promises of implausible returns. White papers of more than 2,000 of the 3,291 projects contained sentences with luring terms such as &ldquo;nothing to lose, guaranteed profit, return on investment, highest return, high return, funds profit, no risk and little risk.&rdquo;State and federal regulators in the United States have previously cracked down on various offerings with similar language, issuing cease and desist orders and at times filing charges against alleged offenders.Additionally, the WSJ tried to identify fake team members by reverse image search of photos of people associated with 343 crypto projects, which did not cite key data about team members. Some documents did not list team members at all, so the Journal searched for names appearing in a list of over one million managed by the U.S. Census Bureau.In August, the WSJ claimed in a study that cryptocurrency price manipulation was largely conducted by organized &ldquo;trading groups&rdquo; using services such as Telegram.

The court documents were published to the Silver Miller website Dec. 26.The case &mdash; which has been filed at the Court of the Southern District of New York on behalf of multiple plaintiffs who invested in the scheme &mdash; alleges that Jeremy Spence, alongside a small cohort of accomplices, orchestrated a fake entity called &ldquo;Coin Signals.&rdquo; Spence is alleged to have deceptively represented himself as a successful crypto trader. He reportedly offered investors in his scheme &ldquo;lucrative returns&rdquo; that he claimed were generated by the series of crypto hedge funds he purported to be managing.These hedge funds reportedly included an &ldquo;Alts Fund,&rdquo; a &ldquo;Long Term Fund,&rdquo; a &ldquo;managed entry&rdquo; to an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) &mdash; dubbed &ldquo;Evermarkets ICO&rdquo; &mdash; and &ldquo;Coin Signals Mex (CSM) Fund,&rdquo; the latter of which is the primary focus of the lawsuit.In truth, the lawsuit contends, the returns were not profits from investments, but &ldquo;were simply reallocations to older investors of new investors&rsquo; assets&rdquo; in a classic Ponzi scheme configuration. As the court documents state, Spence fended off questions from his investors with excuses &mdash; such as hacks and family emergencies &mdash; in order to &ldquo;stall for time and plot his next move.&rdquo;The CSM Fund, as per Silver Miller, was not registered as a hedge fund with any U.S. regulatory authority, and failed to adhere to any of the regulatory requirements a legitimate investment fund is compelled to follow. At its height, the CSM Fund in particular is alleged to have held as much as 1,300 Bitcoin (BTC) deposited by the scheme&rsquo;s investors &mdash; valued at the time at over $10 million.When the CSM fund scheme started to fall apart in late 2018, Spence is alleged to have prevented the fund&rsquo;s participants from withdrawing their assets. The lawsuit thus &ldquo;pleads that the Court rescind the investments in the fraudulent Coin Signals funds; return to the investors their cryptocurrency; impose a monetary penalty against Spence and his collaborators for their fraud, and impose a constructive trust over the assets collected by Spence.&rdquo;As reported earlier this fall, a New York federal court ordered a crypto hedge fund and its CEO &mdash; who had reportedly solicited over $600,000 from at least 80 investors &mdash; to pay over $2.5 million for operating a fraudulent Ponzi scheme. The order was pursuant to an anti-fraud enforcement action first &nbsp;filed by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission against the fund last year.        """

The hackers then empty the wallet balance.&ldquo;[W]hen I logged on it immediately asked me for my 2 factor code which I thought was a little strange as well as Electrum usually only asks for that when you attempt to send,&rdquo; one victim continued in another Reddit post, adding:&ldquo;I kept trying to send and kept getting an error code &lsquo;max fee exceeded no more than 50 sat/B [satoshis per byte]&rsquo; I then restored my wallet on a separate pc and found that my balance had been transferred out in full[.]&rdquo;According to u/normal_rc, several addresses are feeding into one main holding address, which currently contains 243 BTC.Electrum posted about the incident on Twitter today, stating &ldquo;[t]here is an ongoing phishing attack against Electrum users&rdquo; and implored users to check the validity of the resource they were logging into.&ldquo;Our official website is https://electrum.org[.] Do not download Electrum from any other source,&rdquo; the tweet continued.Wallet hacks are less frequent than those afflicting online exchanges, several of which &mdash; most notoriously Japan&rsquo;s Coincheck &mdash; have lost users hundreds of millions of dollars in 2018.
