                    <p>Mainstream newspaper Time published an article illustrating the liberating potential of Bitcoin, especially in countries with oppressive governments.</p>
                    <p><p dir="ltr">Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index/amp">BTC</a>) has a substantial liberating potential, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/usa" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/usa/amp">American</a> mainstream newspaper Time <a href="http://time.com/5486673/bitcoin-venezuela-authoritarian/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">reports</a> on Dec. 28.</p><p>The aforementioned article claims that &ldquo;speculation, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/fraud" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/fraud/amp">fraud</a>, and greed in the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies/amp">cryptocurrency</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain/amp">blockchain</a> industry have overshadowed the real, liberating potential of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/satoshi-nakamoto" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/satoshi-nakamoto/amp">Satoshi Nakamoto&rsquo;s</a> invention.&rdquo;</p><p>According to the article&rsquo;s author, Bitcoin &ldquo;can be a valuable financial tool as a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/anti-censorship" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/anti-censorship/amp">censorship-resistant</a> medium of exchange.&rdquo;</p><p>Alejandro Machado, a cryptocurrency researcher at the Open Money Initiative, reportedly said that the fee on a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/wire-transfer" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/wire-transfer/amp">wire transfer</a> from the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/usa" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/usa/amp">United States</a> to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/venezuela" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/venezuela/amp">Venezuela</a> can be as high as 56 percent.</p><p>To circumvent such conditions, Venezuelans have reportedly turned to cryptocurrency, receiving Bitcoin from their relatives abroad. The main alternative is to wire money to Colombia, withdraw and bring cash to Venezuela, which according to the article, &ldquo;can take far longer, cost more, and be far more dangerous than the Bitcoin option.&rdquo;</p><p>Times suggests that Bitcoin is a good way to protect oneself from <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/fiat" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/fiat/amp">fiat currency</a> <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/inflation" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/inflation/amp">inflation</a>. Venezuela is prime example of that, with the inflation of their native currency projected to top <a href="http://fortune.com/2018/12/17/venezuela-worthless-pensions-the-petro/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank" data-amp="https://amp-timeinc-net.cdn.ampproject.org/c/amp.timeinc.net/fortune/2018/12/17/venezuela-worthless-pensions-the-petro">1 million percent</a>. But there are also other similar examples, like <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/zimbabwe" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/zimbabwe/amp">Zimbabwe</a>, where former president Robert Mugabe &ldquo;printed endless amounts of cash.&rdquo; But the author points out:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;His successors can&rsquo;t print more Bitcoin.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Bitcoin is also, according to the article, a tool to evade mass surveillance in places like <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/china" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/china/amp">China</a>. That being said, as Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/edward-snowden-on-bitcoin-world-needs-better-option-to-avoid-govt-coercion" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/edward-snowden-on-bitcoin-world-needs-better-option-to-avoid-govt-coercion/amp">reported</a> in March, according to U.S. whistleblower <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/edward-snowden" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/edward-snowden/amp">Edward Snowden</a>, Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t optimal for avoiding government coercion, and he believes that the world needs a better option.</p><p>Times also points out the advantage given by the inability of governments to censor transactions or freeze Bitcoin wallets. In fact, Cointelegraph reported in April that <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/wikileaks" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/wikileaks/amp">WikiLeaks&rsquo;</a> Coinbase account has been <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/wikileaks-shop-reports-suspension-of-coinbase-account-due-to-terms-of-service-violation" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/wikileaks-shop-reports-suspension-of-coinbase-account-due-to-terms-of-service-violation/amp">suspended</a> due to a term of service violation.</p><p>Still, nobody can prevent WikiLeaks from using cryptocurrency wallets where the organization controls the private keys. In fact, WikiLeaks is still accepting cryptocurrency donations and also <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/wikileaks-now-accepts-donations-in-the-cryptocurrency-zcash" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/wikileaks-now-accepts-donations-in-the-cryptocurrency-zcash/amp">added support</a> for <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/edward-snowden-on-bitcoin-world-needs-better-option-to-avoid-govt-coercion" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/edward-snowden-on-bitcoin-world-needs-better-option-to-avoid-govt-coercion/amp">Snowden&rsquo;s favorite</a> crypto Zcash in August 2017.</p>

Blockchain Cuties has announced that the TRON version of the game will have unique content, including Cuties, items and probably locations.</p><h2>Future of DApps</h2><p>&ldquo;We have been seeking an opportunity to work with TRON since June 2018 and now, we&rsquo;re finally here,&rdquo; Vladimir Tomko, CEO of Blockchain Cuties says. The game developer believes that adding the TRON community will give the users more opportunity in representing their Cuties in the battlefield. Also, the team hopes that integration Blockchain Cuties to the TRON platform will also help achieve the higher transaction speed which brings more options to the gameplay. The TRON team believes that an <a href="https://o836fhe91.qnssl.com/tron/whitebook/TronWhitepaper_en.pdf" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">extension</a> through the sidechain will help achieve its goal of 1,000 transactions per second (TPS). In comparison, Ethereum enables 15 TPS and Bitcoin 7 TPS.</p><p>Blockchain Cuties says it have a similar vision with TRON. Launched in August 2017, TRON was <a href="https://medium.com/tron-foundation/an-overview-of-tron-and-why-it-is-a-buy-fe58046e11d6" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> as &ldquo;a blockchain-based decentralized protocol that aims to construct a worldwide free content entertainment system with the blockchain and distributed storage technology." The idea of the new project was to allow users to publish, store and own data for free. The content is supposed to be owned by its creators, artists and scriptwriters rather &ldquo;than the capitalists who consume them.&rdquo; This principle goes along with the Blockchain Cuties&rsquo; concept. The game developer says players finally got full ownership of the Cutie&rsquo;s value that they created. The startup notes that the non-fungible tokens can&rsquo;t be taken from their owners and nobody can dictate players on the usage terms. &ldquo;Thus, Blockchain Cuties and TRON are on the same page in terms of TRON&rsquo;s mission,&rdquo; Blockchain Cuties says. &nbsp;</p><p>Blockchain Cuties is the first crypto collectible game placed on TRON Arcade &mdash; the special $100 million <a href="https://www.ccn.com/tron-arcade-wants-to-break-open-the-gaming-industry-for-blockchain/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank" data-amp="https://www-ccn-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.ccn.com/tron-arcade-wants-to-break-open-the-gaming-industry-for-blockchain/amp/">fund</a> created by TRON. &ldquo;TRON Arcade will play a crucial role in encouraging developers to join in our mission and provide the best blockchain gaming experience to users around the world,&rdquo; TRON's founder and CEO Justin Sun said.</p><p><img alt="Pic" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/eae6c126cd92d8883af93e264b36b529.jpg" title="Pic"></p><h2 dir="ltr">Multi-blockchain Cuties</h2><p>The game was released in April 2018 on Ethereum (ETH) as a part of the boom of crypto-collectible games started with the launch of CryptoPunks &mdash; the first blockchain game ever made &mdash; in June 2017.</p><p>The developers offered the users the ability to collect, breed and trade non-fungible tokens of different animals &mdash; including cats, lizards, puppies, bears and, most valuable, fantastic creatures. Every Cutie has different attributes like hair style, eye color and facial hair. All these different features of the digital assets increase its value in cryptocurrency and performance. The players can also take part in roll-the-dice battles within the game. The TRON version of the game will include unique TRON Cuties, which are Red Hedgehog, Fairy Dragon, Bear-o-Bull, LilTronbeary and Tronbeary, and many more.</p><p>In November 2018, Blockchain Cuties <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/first-collectible-on-two-blockchains-the-cutest-crypto-game-now-available-on-eos" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/first-collectible-on-two-blockchains-the-cutest-crypto-game-now-available-on-eos/amp">announced</a> a partnership with EOS. Enabling the game on the EOS ecosystem made Blockchain Cuties &ldquo;the first game which officially supports two blockchains simultaneously,&rdquo; the developer says. Now, the users have the chance to create both ETH- and EOS-based Cuties. Also, one of the main reasons for the partnership with EOS was the support for non-fungible tokens that the platform provides. Finally, Blockchain Cuties hopes EOS will help make transactions faster &mdash; for example, importing a private key now takes less than a minute, which is then stored locally. &nbsp;</p><div><p><span style="font-size: 12px; color: rgb(169, 169, 169);"><span style="font-weight: 600">Disclaimer.</span> Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

A break of the yearly lows will resume the downtrend and will be a negative development. The price action of the next few days will confirm whether a bottom is in place.</p><h2 dir="ltr">XRP/USD</h2><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ripple" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/ripple/amp">Ripple</a> broke below the 20-day EMA on Dec. 27 but has bounced back sharply from the support at $0.33108.

It is currently trading inside a descending channel, that looks like a bullish signal.</p><p dir="ltr"><img alt="BCH" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/764d985589f53e443085aa54196783cb.png" title="BCH"></p><p dir="ltr">On the upside, the virtual currency will face resistance at the channel and above it at the 50-day SMA. If both these levels are crossed, we expect the recovery to resume. The pattern target of the bullish flag is $355, with a minor resistance at $307.10.</p><p dir="ltr">On the contrary, if the bears turnaround the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BCHUSD/?utm_source=cointelegraph&amp;utm_medium=sponsored&amp;utm_campaign=news&amp;utm_term=bch" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">BCH/USD</a> pair from the current levels and break below the channel, it can slide to $108.92 and below that to the low of $73.50.

However, the long-term trend still remains down.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/EOSUSD/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">EOS/USD</a> pair will weaken if it plunges below $2.1733. It will resume its downtrend on a break below $1.55.

The RSI is also in the negative territory. This shows that the bears are trying to make a comeback.</p><p dir="ltr"><img alt="XLM" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/b8b7885f391083b1ca9a8e459790cdd3.png" title="XLM"></p><p dir="ltr">The virtual currency will point to a reversal if it breaks out and closes (UTC time frame) above $0.13427050. Such a move can reach the 50-day SMA and above it to $0.184. We do not see any buy patterns at current levels; hence, we suggest traders remain on the sidelines.</p><p dir="ltr">If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and sinks below $0.10754201, the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XLMUSD/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">XLM/USD</a> pair will decline to the Dec. 15 low of $0.09285498. A break of this level will resume the downtrend.</p><h2 dir="ltr">LTC/USD</h2><p dir="ltr">The bulls could not keep <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/litecoin" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/litecoin/amp">Litecoin</a> above the 20-day EMA and the critical support at $29.349 on Dec. 27. However, the breakdown proved to be temporary because the price has climbed back above the 20-day EMA once again.

This points to a consolidation in the short-term. A rally above $36.428 will complete a head and shoulders pattern that can result in a rally to $49.756. We shall turn positive on a close above $36.428.</p><p dir="ltr">However, if the price reverses direction from the 50-day SMA or $36.428 and plunges below $27.701, a retest of the low is likely. The downtrend will resume if the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LTCUSD/?utm_source=cointelegraph&amp;utm_medium=sponsored&amp;utm_campaign=news&amp;utm_term=ltc" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">LTC/USD</a> pair plummets below $23.10.</p><h2 dir="ltr">BSV/USD</h2><p dir="ltr">Bitcoin SV is range bound between $123.98 and $80.352. The price is currently close to the bottom of the range. A break below $80.352 will be a negative development and will drag the price lower to $65.031. If this level also crumbles, a retest of the low at $38.528 will be in the cards.</p><p dir="ltr"><img alt="BSV" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/394f75634affe551ee35b22bbb8e3b1d.png" title="BSV"></p><p dir="ltr">However, if the bulls succeed in defending $80.352, the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BSVUSD/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">BSV/USD</a> pair will again attempt to move back up to $123.98. Though the range is large enough for trading, we shall wait for the bounce off the supports to sustain before recommending any trade in it. &nbsp;</p><h2 dir="ltr">TRX/USD</h2><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/tron" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/tron/amp">TRON</a> held on to the critical support at $0.0183 for the past three days and is currently rebounding sharply. This shows strong buying at the supports, which is a bullish sign.</p><p dir="ltr"><img alt="TRX" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/5932ab4d73dd51f398af6b44c967ebda.png" title="TRX"></p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TRXUSD/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">TRX/USD</a> pair is likely to consolidate in the large range of $0.0183&ndash;$0.02815521 for a few more days. The digital currency is turning out to be an outperformer, hence, the traders can buy fresh long positions closer to $0.02 with a stop loss just below the support of $0.0183. We like the way the 20-day EMA has continued to slope up after completing the bullish crossover.</p><p dir="ltr">Contrary to our expectation, if the bears sink the price below $0.0183 and the 20-day EMA, a fall to $0.015 is likely. Any break of this level will result in a retest of the lows.</p><h2 dir="ltr">ADA/USD</h2><p dir="ltr">The bulls are attempting to push <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cardano" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/cardano/amp">Cardano</a> above the 20-day EMA once again. There is a tussle between both the bears and the bulls at current levels. The 50-day SMA is sloping down, which means that the long-term trend still remains down. However, the flat 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory, and shows that the bulls have an advantage in the short-term.</p><p dir="ltr"><img alt="ADA" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/16fc9e4eef7bfcb54d6663e8c032ace8.png" title="ADA"></p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ADAUSDT/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">ADA/USD</a> pair will confirm a trend change if the price breaks out and closes (UTC time frame) above the neckline of the probable inverse head and shoulders pattern. We suggest traders wait for the reversal to complete before jumping in to buy.</p><p dir="ltr">If the virtual currency turns down from the 50-day SMA or the trendline and breaks below $0.036934, it can result in a retest of the Dec. 7 low.</p><p><em><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="color:#4e5f70;">Market data is provided by the</span> <a href="https://hitbtc.com/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">HitBTC</a> <span style="color:#4e5f70;">exchange.

                    <p>The company says that, by using social networks and tokens, users can gain access to premium investment services and products.</p>
                    <p><p dir="ltr">The startup aims to start a &ldquo;financial revolution&rdquo; by creating its own social network, where users can earn tokens and spend them by hiring top investment professionals and investing in the products and services they choose. The idea of the Huddl project is to break the traditional investment model, in which the company says that premium products are available only for wealthy people or for institutional investors.</p><p>The Huddl team says the main reason that motivated them to build the platform was the loss of trust in traditional financial services and social networks, and the lack of utility in current blockchain and decentralized application structures.</p><h2>Investment network</h2><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://ihuddl.com/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">Huddl</a> wants to give regular users <a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/former_blackrock_executives_launch_revolutionary_investment_platform/prweb15969376.htm" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">access</a> to such premium investment opportunities like commercial real estate, private banking, hedge funds, pre-IPO stocks, investment management and wealth planning. Normally these high-risk asset classes are not available for the general public, and mainstream investors have to pay much higher fees than institutional ones.</p><p>The Huddl team offers a way to gain access to these premium <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/investment" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/investment/amp">investment</a> services and products by becoming a member of Huddl&rsquo;s own network. The members share their investment preferences and examine the different strategies that are offered within the platform. They can invite friends, relatives and people they know to form an online community or a dynamic investment pool, which Huddl calls a &nbsp;&ldquo;pod.&rdquo; Together, the pool members define the purpose of the investment, agree on the rules, choose the investment strategy, invest their capital and spend their tokens for the goal that they choose. For example, a family can jointly invest for retirement or smaller things, such as a friends vacation. The pod can also invite highly skilled financial professionals to manage their investment program.</p><p>The pools vary according to their size: from pods (the smallest unit in Huddl network) to &ldquo;clusters,&rdquo; which can include multiple pods with shared interests in strategies and investments. According to the company, this system allows Huddl users to pool their money together and increase their collective buying power for gaining access to premium investment opportunities while fully controlling how their capital is managed.</p><p>Within the Huddl network, users can share their ideas and ask for help from advisors and managers. &ldquo;Through social clusters and collaborative idea sharing, individuals are empowered to form their own investment vehicles and have them managed by top private wealth advisors,&rdquo; says Huddl Founder and CEO Stephen Corliss.</p><h2>&ldquo;Deep discounts&rdquo;</h2><p>The Huddl network is based on <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain/amp">blockchain technology</a>. The users can earn their first tokens by <a href="https://ihuddl.com/#tokens" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">joining Huddl</a> &mdash; they get rewarded for bringing new users and adding value to the network, as well as for inviting friends and family to become members. The startup also notes that there is a special social program embedded in the system, which allows every community member to benefit from the growth of the platform.</p><p>Additionally, the users can earn Huddl tokens by interacting, contributing to the teams as a manager or a coordinator, and by investing. The digital currency can be spent on unlocking investment services at &ldquo;deep discounts,&rdquo; which Huddl promises to arrange.</p><div id="post-content"><p><span style="font-size: 12px; color: rgb(169, 169, 169);"><span style="font-weight: 600">Disclaimer.</span> Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

Nonetheless, the bottom line of this interaction is that the Bitcoin is first converted into fiat currency via the state&rsquo;s OhioCrypto.com portal before it reaches government pockets.</p><p>In regard to central banks, Galit went on to argue that:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Central bankers are there to actually help manage economies and provide a kind of stewardship for for those economies [...] Part of that is actually managing currency in the interest rates [for lending] and in exchange rates. If you don&rsquo;t actually have any control over a currency you&rsquo;ve lost one of the major policy tools that you have, so what do you do?&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>As previously reported, major innovators worldwide have dissented from Galit&rsquo;s view. This May, Jack Dorsey &mdash; the CEO of stalwart social media platform <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/twitter" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/twitter/amp">Twitter</a> as well as Bitcoin-supporting payments firm firm <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/square" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/square/amp">Square</a>&nbsp;&mdash; <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-reaffirms-bullish-future-on-bitcoin-crypto-as-global-payment" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-reaffirms-bullish-future-on-bitcoin-crypto-as-global-payment/amp">stated</a> his view that &ldquo;the internet deserves a native currency,&rdquo; placing virtual currencies at the centre of his vision of a future, frictionless means of global payment.

                    <p>A Wall Street Journal has suggested that Bitcoin’s correlation with “traditional” assets markets has been high in recent days.</p>
                    <p><p dir="ltr">A Wall Street Journal (WSJ) article <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/once-a-rebel-bitcoin-is-conforming-to-mainstream-markets-11546005600" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank" data-amp="https://www-wsj-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/once-a-rebel-bitcoin-is-conforming-to-mainstream-markets-11546005600">published</a> today, Dec. 28, suggests that <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index/amp">Bitcoin</a> (BTC)&rsquo;s correlation with traditional assets markets has been high in recent days.</p><p>Citing data from research firm Excalibur Pro Inc., the WSJ states that the top cryptocurrency has traded at a 0.84 correlation to gold over the past five days, where -1 indicates complete inversion and +1 perfect correlation. Moreover, Bitcoin has traded at a 0.77 correlation to the Chicago Board of Options Exchange&rsquo;s Volatility index (VIX), a benchmark index for the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/usa" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/usa/amp">United States</a> equity market volatility.</p><p>While the WSJ frames the strong correlation between traditional markets and what the article dubs as the rebellious first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, as something of an unexpected twist of fate, the article also offers several explanations as to why the pattern may have formed.</p><p>The first is the reported influx of institutional money into the crypto space, with the WSJ citing the growth of Grayscale Investments&rsquo; over-the-counter exchange-traded fund (ETF), the Bitcoin Investment Trust, as a prime example.</p><p>As per the article, the trust saw $51 million in assets under management (AUM) during its first year (2013). By the end of 2017, in the midst of the crypto market bull run, AUM had surged to around &nbsp;$3.5 billion. As of recently &mdash; due to the so-called &ldquo;crypto winter&rdquo; &mdash; the trust reportedly retains about $900 million AUM.</p><p>Another factor proffered is venture capital (VC) investment. The WSJ reports that whereas in 2013, VC investment in Bitcoin and the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain/amp">blockchain</a> sector was at around $96 million, this grew to $500 million in 2016 and to over $2 billion in all-time VC crypto investment through the end of 2017. The WSJ gives no fresh data for 2018.</p><p>As the article notes, a pull factor for traditional capital into crypto is the building of trading services and infrastructure with high regulatory compliance; the advent of crypto futures trading, and attempts to gain broad acceptance for crypto-based ETFs.</p><p>As reported, the crypto space continues to undergo <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-financialization-of-the-crypto-ecosystem-is-accelerating-expert-take" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/the-financialization-of-the-crypto-ecosystem-is-accelerating-expert-take/amp">far-ranging transformation</a>; major developments on the horizon include the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/nyse-operator-announces-new-global-digital-assets-platform-plans-bitcoin-futures-launch" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/nyse-operator-announces-new-global-digital-assets-platform-plans-bitcoin-futures-launch/amp">launch</a> of the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bakkt" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/bakkt/amp">Bakkt</a> Bitcoin futures exchange from Intercontinental Exchange, the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/investment-giant-fidelity-launches-digital-assets-services-targeting-institutional-investors" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/investment-giant-fidelity-launches-digital-assets-services-targeting-institutional-investors/amp">launch</a> of investment giant Fidelity&rsquo;s digital assets business, and the continued influx of stalwart investors such as <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/yale-university-invested-in-new-400-million-crypto-focused-fund-says-report" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/yale-university-invested-in-new-400-million-crypto-focused-fund-says-report/amp">Yale</a>, Harvard and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/report-harvard-stanford-mit-endowments-all-invest-in-crypto-funds" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/report-harvard-stanford-mit-endowments-all-invest-in-crypto-funds/amp">Stanford Universities</a>.</p>

                    <p>A recent study by the WSJ has revealed that hundreds of crypto offerings showed signs of fraudulent activity, improbable returns and plagiarism.</p>
                    <p><p dir="ltr">Recent research by the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/graphics/whitepapers/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">published</a> Dec. 27 revealed that hundreds of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies/amp">cryptocurrency</a> offerings showed signs of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/fraud" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/fraud/amp">fraudulent</a> activity, improbable returns and plagiarism.</p><p>In the course of its research, the WSJ downloaded &ldquo;white papers&rdquo; of 3,291 cryptocurrency projects that announced an initial coin offering (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ico" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/ico/amp">ICO</a>) from three websites &mdash; ICOBench.com, Tokendata.io and ICORating.com.</p><p>A white paper is an informational document issued by a company that describes the company&rsquo;s position, team biography, and technical specifics of a project, and is designed to be used as a marketing tool for potential investors.</p><p>The reporters further conducted an analysis of the documents, excluding duplicate and non-English papers:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;To identify duplicate language, the Journal compared sentences with at least 10 unique words to every other sentence in other white papers. Reporters then read and reviewed nearly 10,000 sentences appearing more than once among the 3,291 papers analyzed and removed technical and legal sounding language. Then, the Journal compared reported offering dates to determine which document first published any given sentence and excluded those projects from this database.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>The analysis reportedly indicated that 16 percent &mdash; or 513 &mdash; of the aforementioned white papers showed signs of plagiarism, identity theft and promises of implausible returns. White papers of more than 2,000 of the 3,291 projects contained sentences with luring terms such as &ldquo;nothing to lose, guaranteed profit, return on <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/investments" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/investments/amp">investment</a>, highest return, high return, funds profit, no risk and little risk.&rdquo;</p><p>State and federal regulators in the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/usa" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/usa/amp">United States</a> have previously <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/operation-cryptosweep-results-in-200-crypto-related-investigations" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/operation-cryptosweep-results-in-200-crypto-related-investigations/amp">cracked down</a> on various offerings with similar language, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/four-crypto-firms-ordered-to-cease-and-desist-by-colorado-securities-commissioner" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/four-crypto-firms-ordered-to-cease-and-desist-by-colorado-securities-commissioner/amp">issuing</a> cease and desist orders and at times <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-sec-suspends-securities-trading-of-nevada-based-firm-for-false-crypto-claims" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/us-sec-suspends-securities-trading-of-nevada-based-firm-for-false-crypto-claims/amp">filing</a> charges against alleged offenders.</p><p>Additionally, the WSJ tried to identify fake team members by reverse image search of photos of people associated with 343 crypto projects, which did not cite key data about team members. Some documents did not list team members at all, so the Journal searched for names appearing in a list of over one million managed by the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/usa" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/usa/amp">U.S.</a> Census Bureau.</p><p>In August, the WSJ <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/wsj-organized-crypto-trading-groups-manipulated-markets-to-make-825-million-in-2018" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/wsj-organized-crypto-trading-groups-manipulated-markets-to-make-825-million-in-2018/amp">claimed</a> in a study that cryptocurrency price manipulation was largely conducted by organized &ldquo;trading groups&rdquo; using services such as <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/telegram" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/telegram/amp">Telegram</a>. The WSJ suggested that coordinated &ldquo;pump and dump&rdquo; schemes had seen traders inflate and crash the prices of various cryptocurrencies this year.</p>

The acquisition marks the first step in the crypto company&rsquo;s ambitions to purchase a set of international soccer clubs and make its ERC20 token, Liber, a mandatory form of payment in the stadiums of those clubs it owns.</p><p>Libereum states it secured its purchase of the Segunda Divisi&oacute;n (second division) A club with a bank guarantee of &euro;4.3 million (about $4.9 million) as an initial down payment.

                    <p>U.S. crypto investor law firm Silver Miller has filed a lawsuit against a purported crypto hedge fund manager who was allegedly operating a fraudulent Ponzi scheme.</p>
                    <p><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="http://cointelegraph.com/tags/usa" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/usa/amp">United States</a> crypto-focused law firm Silver Miller has filed a lawsuit against a purported crypto hedge fund manager who was allegedly operating a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/fraud" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/fraud/amp">fraudulent</a> <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ponzi-scheme" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/ponzi-scheme/amp">Ponzi</a> scheme. The court documents were <a href="https://www.silvermillerlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2018-12-26-DE-1-COMPLAINT.pdf" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">published</a> to the Silver Miller website Dec. 26.</p><p>The case &mdash; which has been filed at the Court of the Southern District of New York on behalf of multiple plaintiffs who invested in the scheme &mdash; alleges that Jeremy Spence, alongside a small cohort of accomplices, orchestrated a fake entity called &ldquo;Coin Signals.&rdquo; Spence is alleged to have deceptively represented himself as a successful crypto trader. He reportedly offered investors in his scheme &ldquo;lucrative returns&rdquo; that he claimed were generated by the series of crypto hedge funds he purported to be managing.</p><p>These hedge funds reportedly included an &ldquo;Alts Fund,&rdquo; a &ldquo;Long Term Fund,&rdquo; a &ldquo;managed entry&rdquo; to an Initial Coin Offering (<a href="http://cointelegraph.com/tags/ico" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/ico/amp">ICO</a>) &mdash; dubbed &ldquo;Evermarkets ICO&rdquo; &mdash; and &ldquo;Coin Signals Mex (CSM) Fund,&rdquo; the latter of which is the primary focus of the lawsuit.</p><p>In truth, the lawsuit contends, the returns were not profits from investments, but &ldquo;were simply reallocations to older investors of new investors&rsquo; assets&rdquo; in a classic Ponzi scheme configuration. As the court documents state, Spence fended off questions from his investors with excuses &mdash; such as hacks and family emergencies &mdash; in order to &ldquo;stall for time and plot his next move.&rdquo;</p><p>The CSM Fund, as per Silver Miller, was not registered as a hedge fund with any U.S. regulatory authority, and failed to adhere to any of the regulatory requirements a legitimate investment fund is compelled to follow. At its height, the CSM Fund in particular is alleged to have held as much as 1,300 Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index/amp">BTC</a>) deposited by the scheme&rsquo;s investors &mdash; valued at the time at over $10 million.</p><p>When the CSM fund scheme started to fall apart in late 2018, Spence is alleged to have prevented the fund&rsquo;s participants from withdrawing their assets. The lawsuit thus &ldquo;pleads that the Court rescind the investments in the fraudulent Coin Signals funds; return to the investors their cryptocurrency; impose a monetary penalty against Spence and his collaborators for their fraud, and impose a constructive trust over the assets collected by Spence.&rdquo;</p><p>As <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-hedge-fund-and-ceo-slapped-with-25-million-penalty-for-ponzi-scheme" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-hedge-fund-and-ceo-slapped-with-25-million-penalty-for-ponzi-scheme/amp">reported</a> earlier this fall, a New York federal <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/court" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/court/amp">court</a> ordered a crypto hedge fund and its CEO &mdash; who had reportedly solicited over $600,000 from at least 80 investors &mdash; to pay over $2.5 million for operating a fraudulent Ponzi scheme.
